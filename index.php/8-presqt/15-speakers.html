Jeff completed his undergraduate work at the University of Notre Dame, where he also earned his Masters while in a joint program in Psychology and Computer Science. He went on to receive his Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology from the University of Virginia. His dissertation included the development of the Open Science Framework--a free, open source workflow management system and scholarly commons that is now the flagship product of COS.</p>
